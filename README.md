# Dino_sum_pairs
A Python project that generates and visualizes the number of distinct pairs from 1 to 10 whose sums form a pyramid-shaped distribution. It demonstrates combinatorics concepts with an intuitive plot using matplotlib.

## Features

- Generates all distinct pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10`
- Groups pairs by their sum
- Counts and visualizes the frequency of each sum as a pyramid plot
- Includes a detailed list of pairs grouped by sum
